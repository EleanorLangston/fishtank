# Welcome!
This is the Arduino code from an older project that I worked on for a fishtank that could self-regulate temperature and salinity and display the current values for each via a simple LCD screen component. 

It is ultimately rather simple code and is far from the best expression of my programming ability as it is from several years prior, 
but it demonstrates a project I have worked on in the past that is relevant to positions involving lower level programming and embedded systems.
